# Cone-Marching-2D

This is a simple 2D cone marching project.

## Description

This project demonstrates the concept of cone marching in a 2D environment. Cone marching is an optimization for ray marching where instead of marching a ray, we march a cone which can be considered a set of multiple rays. In a sense, we are marching multiple rays at once with one calculation.
